## Google Play Store Data Analysis - Project Documentation

1. Project Overview
Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze Google Play Store data to extract meaningful insights about app ratings, installs, revenue, and user engagement. The analysis aims to identify trends, compare free vs. paid apps, and determine factors influencing app success.


3. Dataset Details
Dataset Name
Play Store Data Cleaned.csv
Source
Google Play Store data
Key Columns
- App Name
- Category
- Rating
- Reviews
- Installs
- Type (Free/Paid)
- Price
- Content Rating
- Revenue

- 
4. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values
- Removed rows with missing critical values (Rating, Installs, Reviews).
- Imputed missing values where necessary (e.g., replacing null ratings with category-wise averages).
Data Type Conversions
- Converted Installs column from object to integer by removing `+` and `,` symbols.
- Converted Price and Revenue columns to float for financial analysis.
- Changed Last Updated column to Date format.
Outlier Handling
- Removed extreme outliers in Revenue and Installs to avoid skewed analysis.
- Filtered apps with unrealistic ratings (e.g., greater than 5).
Feature Engineering
- Derived Revenue using `Installs * Price` for paid apps.
- Categorized apps based on installs (e.g., Low, Medium, High installs).
- Extracted Year from the 'Last Updated' column to analyze trends over time.
- 
5. Power BI Dashboard Implementation
Visualizations & Interactivity
- Used Bar, Column, Pie, Scatter, and Line Charts.
- Implemented Slicers for Category, Free/Paid, Installs Range, and Rating Range.
- Enabled drill-through and cross-filtering for deeper analysis.
DAX Measures Used
```DAX
Avg_Rating = AVERAGE(PlayStore[Rating])
Total_Revenue = SUM(PlayStore[Revenue])
Apps_Per_Category = COUNT(PlayStore[App])
Free_Paid_Percentage = 
    DIVIDE(
        COUNTROWS(FILTER(PlayStore, PlayStore[Type] = "Free")),
        COUNTROWS(PlayStore),
        0
    )
```
6. Conclusion & Future Improvements
Key Findings
âœ… Education & Productivity apps perform well in ratings.
âœ… Social media & entertainment apps lead in installs.
âœ… Paid apps have lower installs but generate higher revenue per user.
âœ… Frequent updates contribute to app success.
âœ… There is no strong correlation between ratings and installs.
Future Enhancements
- Include user sentiment analysis using NLP on app reviews.
- Use machine learning to predict app success based on historical data.
- Implement a real-time dashboard with API integration for live tracking.
